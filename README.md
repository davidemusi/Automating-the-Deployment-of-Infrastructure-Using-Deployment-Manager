Overview
Deployment Manager is an infrastructure deployment service that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud resources. Write flexible template and configuration files and use them to create deployments that have a variety of Cloud Platform services, such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL, configured to work together.

In this lab, you create a Deployment Manager configuration with a template to automate the deployment of Google Cloud infrastructure. Specifically, you deploy one auto mode network with a firewall rule and two VM instances, as shown in this diagram:

diagram.png

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create a configuration for an auto mode network

Create a configuration for a firewall rule

Create a template for VM instances

Create and deploy a configuration

Verify the deployment of a configuration

Qwiklabs setup
For each lab, you get a new GCP project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

Make sure you signed into Qwiklabs using an incognito window.

Note the lab's access time (for example, img/time.png and make sure you can finish in that time block.

There is no pause feature. You can restart if needed, but you have to start at the beginning.

When ready, click img/start_lab.png.

Note your lab credentials. You will use them to sign in to Cloud Platform Console. img/open_google_console.png

Click Open Google Console.

Click Use another account and copy/paste credentials for this lab into the prompts.

If you use other credentials, you'll get errors or incur charges.

Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.
Do not click End Lab unless you are finished with the lab or want to restart it. This clears your work and removes the project.

Task 1. Configure the network
A configuration describes all the resources you want for a single deployment.

Verify that the Deployment Manager API is enabled
In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click APIs & services > Library.

In the search bar, type Deployment Manager, and click the result for Google Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API.

Verify that the API is enabled.

Start the Cloud Shell Editor
To write the configuration and the template, you use the Cloud Shell Editor.

In the Cloud Console, click Activate Cloud Shell (Cloud Shell).

If prompted, click Continue.

Run the following commands:

mkdir dminfra
cd dminfra

In Cloud Shell, click Launch code editor (Cloud Shell Editor).

In the left pane of the code editor, expand the dminfra folder.

Create the auto mode network configuration
A configuration is a file written in YAML syntax that lists each of the resources you want to create and their respective resource properties. A configuration must contain a resources: section followed by the list of resources to create. Start the configuration with the mynetwork resource.

To create a new file, click File > New File.

Name the new file config.yaml, and then open it.

Copy the following base code into config.yaml:

resources:
# Create the auto-mode network
- name: [RESOURCE_NAME]
  type: [RESOURCE_TYPE]
  properties:
    #RESOURCE properties go here

Indentation is important in YAML.

True

False

This base configuration is a great starting point for any Google Cloud resource. The name field allows you to name the resource, and the type field allows you to specify the Google Cloud resource that you want to create. You can also define properties, but these are optional for some resources.

In config.yaml, replace [RESOURCE_NAME] with mynetwork

To get a list of all available network resource types in Google Cloud, run the following command in Cloud Shell:

gcloud deployment-manager types list | grep network

The output should look like this (do not copy; this is example output):

compute.beta.subnetwork
compute.alpha.subnetwork
compute.v1.subnetwork
compute.beta.network
compute.v1.network
compute.alpha.network

For a normal Deployment Manager configuration, which subnetwork resource type would you use? (assume these three options are available)

compute.beta.subnetwork

compute.alpha.subnetwork

compute.v1.subnetwork

Alternatively, you can find the full list of available resource types here.

Locate compute.v1.network, which is the type needed to create a VPC network using Deployment Manager.

In config.yaml, replace [RESOURCE_TYPE] with compute.v1.network

Add the following property to config.yaml:

autoCreateSubnetworks: true

By definition, an auto mode network automatically creates a subnetwork in each region. Therefore, you are setting autoCreateSubnetworks to true.

Verify that config.yaml looks like this, including the spacing/indentation:

resources:
# Create the auto-mode network
- name: mynetwork
  type: compute.v1.network
  properties:
    autoCreateSubnetworks: true

To save config.yaml, click File > Save.

Task 2. Configure the firewall rule
In order to allow ingress traffic instances in mynetwork, you need to create a firewall rule.

Add the firewall rule to the configuration
Add a firewall rule that allows HTTP, SSH, RDP, and ICMP traffic on mynetwork.

Copy the following base code into config.yaml (below the mynetwork resource):

# Create the firewall rule
- name: mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp
  type: [RESOURCE_TYPE]
  properties:
    #RESOURCE properties go here

To get a list of all available firewall rule resource types in Google Cloud, run the following command in Cloud Shell:

gcloud deployment-manager types list | grep firewall

The output should look like this (do not copy; this is example output):

compute.v1.firewall
compute.alpha.firewall
compute.beta.firewall

Locate compute.v1.firewall, which is the type needed to create a firewall rule using Deployment Manager.

In config.yaml, replace [RESOURCE_TYPE] with compute.v1.firewall

In config.yaml, add the following properties for the firewall rule:

  network: $(ref.mynetwork.selfLink)
  sourceRanges: ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  allowed:
  - IPProtocol: TCP
    ports: [22, 80, 3389]
  - IPProtocol: ICMP

These properties define:

network: Network that the firewall rule applies to
sourceRange: Source IP ranges that traffic is allowed from
IPProtocol: Specific protocol that the rule applies to
ports: Specific ports of that protocol
Because firewall rules depend on their network, you are using the $(ref.mynetwork.selfLink) reference to instruct Deployment Manager to resolve these resources in a dependent order. Specifically, the network is created before the firewall rule. By default, Deployment Manager creates all resources in parallel, so there is no guarantee that dependent resources are created in the correct order unless you use references.

Verify that config.yaml looks like this, including the spacing/indentation:

resources:
# Create the auto-mode network
- name: mynetwork
  type: compute.v1.network
  properties:
    autoCreateSubnetworks: true

# Create the firewall rule
- name: mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp
  type: compute.v1.firewall
  properties:
    network: $(ref.mynetwork.selfLink)
    sourceRanges: ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    allowed:
    - IPProtocol: TCP
      ports: [22, 80, 3389]
    - IPProtocol: ICMP

To save config.yaml, click File > Save.

Task 3. Create a template for VM instances
Deployment Manager allows you to use Python or Jinja2 templates to parameterize your configuration. This allows you to reuse common deployment paradigms such as networks, firewall rules, and VM instances.

Create the VM instance template
Because you will be creating two similar VM instances, create a VM instance template.

To create a new file, click File > New File.

Name the new file instance-template.jinja, and then open it.

Copy the following base code into instance-template.jinja:

resources:
- name: [RESOURCE_NAME]
  type: [RESOURCE_TYPE]
  properties:
    #RESOURCE properties go here

In instance-template.jinja, replace [RESOURCE_NAME] with {{ env["name"] }}. Make sure to include the double brackets {{}}.

This is an environment variable that will be provided by the configuration so that you can reuse the template for multiple instances.

To get a list of all available instance resource types in Google Cloud, run the following command in Cloud Shell:

gcloud deployment-manager types list | grep instance

The output should look like this (do not copy; this is example output):

...
compute.v1.instance
compute.alpha.instance

Locate compute.v1.instance, which is the type needed to create a VM instance using Deployment Manager.

In instance-template.jinja, replace [RESOURCE_TYPE] with compute.v1.instance

Specify the VM instance properties
To create a VM instance in the correct zone and network, you need to define these as properties.

In instance-template.jinja, add the following properties for the VM instance:

     machineType: zones/{{ properties["zone"] }}/machineTypes/{{ properties["machineType"] }}
     zone: {{ properties["zone"] }}
     networkInterfaces:
      - network: {{ properties["network"] }}
        subnetwork: {{ properties["subnetwork"] }}
        accessConfigs:
        - name: External NAT
          type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
     disks:
      - deviceName: {{ env["name"] }}
        type: PERSISTENT
        boot: true
        autoDelete: true
        initializeParams:
          sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9

These properties define:

machineType: Machine type and zone
zone: Instance zone
networkInterfaces: Network and subnetwork that VM is attached to
accessConfigs: Required to give the instance a public IP address (required in this lab). To create instances with only an internal IP address, remove the accessConfigs section.
disks: The boot disk, its name and image
Most properties are defined as template properties, which you will provide values for from the top-level configuration (config.yaml).

Verify that instance-template.jinja looks like this, including the spacing/indentation:

resources:
- name: {{ env["name"] }}
  type: compute.v1.instance  
  properties:
     machineType: zones/{{ properties["zone"] }}/machineTypes/{{ properties["machineType"] }}
     zone: {{ properties["zone"] }}
     networkInterfaces:
      - network: {{ properties["network"] }}
        subnetwork: {{ properties["subnetwork"] }}
        accessConfigs:
        - name: External NAT
          type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
     disks:
      - deviceName: {{ env["name"] }}
        type: PERSISTENT
        boot: true
        autoDelete: true
        initializeParams:
          sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9

To save instance-template.jinja, click File > Save.

Task 4. Deploy the configuration
Configure the instances and deploy the configuration.

Import the template
Templates are included in the *.yaml configuration using import:.

Copy the following into config.yaml (before resources):

imports:
- path: instance-template.jinja

The import statement defines the template that you want to use in your configuration. You can import multiple templates in one configuration. For example, you could create templates for the firewall rule and networks if you want to reuse those.

Configure VM instances in each network
Create the mynet-us-vm and mynet-eu-vm instances.

Add the mynet-us-vm instance to config.yaml (within the resources block):

# Create the mynet-us-vm instance
- name: mynet-us-vm
  type: instance-template.jinja
  properties:
    zone: us-central1-a
    machineType: n1-standard-1
    network: $(ref.mynetwork.selfLink)
    subnetwork: regions/us-central1/subnetworks/mynetwork

Add the mynet-eu-vm instance to config.yaml (within the resources block):

# Create the mynet-eu-vm instance
- name: mynet-eu-vm
  type: instance-template.jinja
  properties:
    zone: europe-west1-d
    machineType: n1-standard-1
    network: $(ref.mynetwork.selfLink)  
    subnetwork: regions/europe-west1/subnetworks/mynetwork

The zone, machineType, and subnetwork are passed from this configuration to the template. This allows you to create only one template for multiple VM instances. Also, references to the network are used for the VM instances. This ensures that the network is created before the VM that is attached to that network.

To save config.yaml, click File > Save.
If you want to use a different operating system or different operating system version, which property of the instance resource should you change?

deviceName

machineType

sourceImage

type

Deploy the configuration
It's time to deploy your configuration from Cloud Shell.

In Cloud Shell, run the following command:

gcloud deployment-manager deployments create dminfra --config=config.yaml --preview

The output should look like this (do not copy; this is example output):

NAME                               TYPE                 STATE      
mynet-eu-vm                        compute.v1.instance  IN_PREVIEW
mynet-us-vm                        compute.v1.instance  IN_PREVIEW
mynetwork                          compute.v1.network   IN_PREVIEW
mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp  compute.v1.firewall  IN_PREVIEW

The --preview flag gives you a preview of how your configuration is applied before creating it. Previewing a configuration causes Deployment Manager to start creating your deployment but then stop before actually creating any resources. The --preview flag is especially useful when you update a deployment.

Run the following command to create the deployment:

gcloud deployment-manager deployments update dminfra

The update command commits the preview. If you don't preview a configuration, you can directly run the following command:

gcloud deployment-manager deployments create dminfra --config=config.yaml

Wait for the resources to be created and listed in Cloud Shell.

The output should look like this (do not copy; this is example output):

NAME                               TYPE                 STATE      ERRORS  INTENT
mynet-eu-vm                        compute.v1.instance  COMPLETED  []
mynet-us-vm                        compute.v1.instance  COMPLETED  []
mynetwork                          compute.v1.network   COMPLETED  []
mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp  compute.v1.firewall  COMPLETED  []

If something goes wrong with the preview or creation of the deployment, try to use the error messages to troubleshoot the source of the issue. You must delete the Deployment Manager configuration before you can try deploying it again. This can be achieved with this command in Cloud Shell:

gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete dminfra

If you cannot troubleshoot the issue of your deployment, take a look at this finished configuration (config.yaml) and template (instance-template.jinja).

When Deployment Manager creates the resources, they are always created sequentually, one at a time.

True

False

Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Create network, firewall rules and VM instances
Task 5. Verify your deployment
Verify your network in the Cloud Console
In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click VPC network > VPC networks.

View the mynetwork VPC network with a subnetwork in every region.

On the Navigation menu, click VPC network > Firewall.

Sort the firewall rules by Network.

View the mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp firewall rule for mynetwork.

Verify your VM instances in the Cloud Console
On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.

View the mynet-us-vm and mynet-eu-vm instances.

Note the internal IP address for mynet-eu-vm.

For mynet-us-vm, click SSH to launch a terminal and connect.

To test connectivity to mynet-eu-vm's internal IP address, run the following command in the SSH terminal (replacing mynet-eu-vm's internal IP address with the value noted earlier):

ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's internal IP here>

This should work because both VM instances are on the same network and the firewall rule allows ICMP traffic!

Task 6. Review
In this lab, you created a Deployment Manager configuration and template to automate the deployment of Google Cloud infrastructure. Templates can be very flexible because of their environment and template variables. Therefore, the benefit of creating templates is that they can be reused across many configurations.

Template variables are abstract properties that allow you to declare the value to be passed to the template in the *.yaml configuration file. You can change the value for each deployment in the *.yaml file without having to make changes to the underlying templates.

Environment variables allow you to reuse templates in different projects and deployments. Instead of representing properties of resources, they represent more global properties such as a Project ID or the name of the deployment. You can use the template that you created as a starting point for future deployments.
